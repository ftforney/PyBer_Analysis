# PyBer Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to take the data from city_data.csv and ride_data.csv located in the Resources directory, and visualize the data. Our goal is to display the total amount of fares for each city type by week, and we achieved just that!

## Results

Using the figure above, we can easily see what the total fares for each week of a month is. The legend was automatically placed in such a way that you can still see the points of data!

In the above figures, we can see the total amount of drivers per city type, as well as the percentage of them per city type. We can see that Urban really outstands against the other city types in terms of driver count.

Next, let's take a look at the ride data, where we can see how many rides each city type gets.

There are lots of rides in Urban type areas! They beat the others by quite a bit, even setting an outlier there.

What about the fare data?

Rural areas have quite a large amount over the other types of cities. This can probably be explained by the vast distance it can take to get from Point A to Point B in rural areas, there would be quite a high fare for that.

Let's look at the total fare percentages for each city type now.

Even with some pretty high amounts, rural is still a small portion of the bigger picture, and we can see that Urban areas are the main highlight.

Finally, let's see a Bubble Chart!

Note: In this, the Driver Count is represented by the smaller and bigger circle sizes. The bigger a circle, the more drivers.

As we can see, rural areas tend to have a higher average fare like we discovered earlier, but the driver counts are quite low compared to other areas. Just look at the Urban areas!

## Summary

We can take away a lot from all of this data, but what are some things that I would focus on?:
1. I recommend cutting back on the amount of drivers per city, since the driver count seems to outweigh actual ride counts.
2. Create promotions to riders that could attract them to the service in the future, specifically for Suburban areas!
3. Focus on increasing the amount of drivers doing Rural fares by a bit, as there seems to be a bit more business there than expected.
